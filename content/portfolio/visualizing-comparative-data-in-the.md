Visualizing how clusters of morphologically similar or disparate species are related phylogenetically is an important question-generating step in exploratory analysis of comparative data. As I continue developing this little app into a tool that I can apply to my own research, the most important future features will be (1) for data selected in either component of the app window to be reflected in the other (a simple idea, but somewhat complicated to implement, it turns out), and (2) for the input data to be extensible to less &quot;tidy&quot; real-world data sets.
