Using the Austin Animal Center's publicly available dataset of outcomes, October 2013-present, this shiny app allows the user to select the month they plan to visit; type, age, and sex of the animal they are looking for, to see what breeds might be available. If the prospective pet owner is searching for one of the top breeds, they can select the bar next to that breed to have a distribution of the breed across the entire year display below the main plot, as shown for the English Pointer mix, in this example.
