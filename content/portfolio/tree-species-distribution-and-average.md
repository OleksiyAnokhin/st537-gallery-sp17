The forest inventory and analysis (FIA) branch of the US Forest Service (USFS) collects,
compiles and shares forest inventory data for the United States. The data for this
analysis are derived from permanent forest plots installed and maintained by the FIA across Oregon. These are typically remeasured on a 10-year cycle. This provides an excellent opportunity to study current forest conditions as well as forest change over time.

 This analysis is intended to provide a visualization of how several common tree species are distributed across Oregon with respect to elevation, and how simple measures of growth correlate to these regions.  This is a demonstration and is not meant to be used for further analysis or as a decision making tool.
