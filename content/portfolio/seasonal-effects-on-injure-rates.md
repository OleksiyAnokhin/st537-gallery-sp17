The data was collected from National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2011-2013. My interests started from injure rates of gender effect, age effects, and special comparison between sports. However, I ended up look at the seasonal effects cross top 10 popular sports, and the seasonal effect is dramatic. It's also my first time to use Shiny app, so I thought it would be a great idea to share with people how are interested in the facts. Happy summer everyone! (Be careful when do exercise.)
