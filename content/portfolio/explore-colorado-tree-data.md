One of the common stories in Colorado forests is the change in species composition and growth rate across the elevation gradient. Because of Colorado's unique topography, with drastic changes in elevation across short horizontal distances, this aspect of Colorado forests is one of the things that makes the state so unique. These plots quantify tree growth as it relates to age and elevation, and tree presence at elevation. The user can input different elevation bands, examine different species, and split the top graph into 1000' facets for easier visualization.
