The two plots in the poster answered two questions that occurred to me when I was working on this H1-B visa application dataset (there's a brief introduction of H1-B visa and the source of the dataset in the poster). First, which cities sponsors most H1-B visas for statisticians and which offers the highest salary for the same group among those cities? Second, how does the job opportunity and salary change in the past 5 years with time? Take a look at the visualizations if you are interested, too!
