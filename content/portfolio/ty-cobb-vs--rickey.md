Basically, there was a baseball player from olden days, Ty Cobb, who was known as a great baserunner, and set a lot of records, including the ones for Runs scored and Stolen Bases.  Over time, many of his records were broken.  The current record holder for Runs scored and Stolen Bases is Rickey Henderson.  My project is a comparison of the careers of the two.
